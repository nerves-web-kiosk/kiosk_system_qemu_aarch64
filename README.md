# Web kiosk system for QEMU/aarch64

This is the Nerves base system for the [Qemu ARM system emulator](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/target-arm.html). It is focused on ARM64 and intended to be used with [Little Loader](https://github.com/fhunleth/little_loader).

## Usage

When using this for your Nerves system the details of the qemu command-line args
can vary a bit based on your environment. To help with this we provide a mix
task to generate a command:

```
mix nerves.gen.qemu
```

If it can determine that you likely can support KVM acceleration or you are on
Apple Silicon and can use HVF acceleration it will provide those. Otherwise it
falls back to full emulation.

The guest Nerves device can be accessed via the console or by SSH via port 10022.

To upload firmware, run:

```sh
mix upload localhost --port 10022
```
